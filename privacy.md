Hi, I'm Steve.

I use Linux, and self-host a lot of the services I depend on. I value your privacy just like I value mine.

For this reason, I've opted to not use Google Adsense, Google Analytics, Google Fonts, or any other Google service on this site; and instead use [Cloudflare Analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/) since it's privacy focused, doesn't use cookies or localStorage, and I'm using Cloudflare anyway.

[Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/), which is a Google reCAPTCHA alternative with a usability and privacy focus, is also used to reduce spam comments.

Fonts and other assets are served locally, to reduce the amount of third-party requests made by the site; and FLoC is disabled on this site (thanks [Clean up the web!](https://cleanuptheweb.org/)).

Hi, I'm Steve.

I'm a Linux, Firefox, uBlock Origin, and Decentraleyes user, High School VPN creator, and probably done some other privacy things too.

I value your privacy just like I value mine.

For this reason, I've opted to not use Google Adsense, Google Analytics, Google Fonts, or any other Google service on this site; and instead use Cloudflare analytics since it's privacy focused, doesn't use cookies or localStorage, and I'm using Cloudflare anyway. [Read more about Cloudflare analytics here](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/).

I am also using [Bunny Fonts](https://fonts.bunny.net/), a privacy focused Google Fonts alternative.

However, at the moment I am using Disqus for comments, while they aren't great, they do honour Do Not Track requests, and have an opt-in 'Privacy Mode'. [Read more about Disqus' privacy here](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717103-disqus-privacy-policy). I will be replacing Disqus with a self-coded Cloudflare Workers based comment system eventually.

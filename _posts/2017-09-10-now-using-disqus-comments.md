We Decided to use Disqus for our comments because Disqus had way more features than our old comments sectionÂ <!--more-->Some of the features that made us install Disqus was the new toxicity filter but the automated spam moderation could also come in handy, there are way more features that were not available with our old comments plugin that pretty much sold Disqus to us.

For people who want to put Disqus on their website Disqus is available here [disqus.com](https://disqus.com/)

title:  "The Best Way to Stream MikroTik's Packet Sniffer to Wireshark"
---

While you can use `udp.dstport == 37008` to filter for MikroTik's packet sniffer, I prefer to setup the 'UDP Listener remote capture: udpdump' feature in Wireshark. This way you will have a clean packet capture without having to filter out unrelated traffic, with the benefit of also not spamming your router with ICMP 'Destination Unreachable' packets.

#### Requirements

Now there is a reason why this isn't often recommended, and that's because it requires the UDPdump component, which isn't selected by default when you install Wireshark on Windows. So you may need to reinstall Wireshark and select the 'UDPdump' component in the installer.

On Debian it's included in the `wireshark-common` package, which should be installed automatically. I'd assume other distributions would be similar.

#### Setup

1. In the 'Capture' menu, click the little gear icon next to "UDP Listener remote capture: udpdump".

2. A new window will open, enter your configured listen port (default is `37008`) and enter `tzsp` as the payload type.

3. Click 'Save' and then 'Start' to begin capturing packets.

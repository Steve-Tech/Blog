**So&#8230; in short JAS Tech looks cooler and is way more secure.**

<!--more-->

### What we’ve done:

You may have noticed that the background has moving ‘particles’ this is because of a [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) plugin I added, Click on the background and watch more spawn in.

In the footer, this badge is shown:  
<a href="https://www.gravityscan.com/verify/ac1c5c85f6fc35f241a5ddce8c1fc230d0cb8df7ea0f3f0b8745a3f24c685728" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://badges.gravityscan.com/badges/jas-team.net-ac1c5c85f6fc35f241a5ddce8c1fc230d0cb8df7ea0f3f0b8745a3f24c685728" alt="Website Malware Scan" width="117" height="67" /></a>  
If you can see it, [Gravityscan](https://www.gravityscan.com/) says the site is safe and secure with no malware.

EDIT: Gravityscan is shutting down on March 8th, 2018 and they have since removed the badge from all websites, as long as the Hardenize badge is there and it had a lock beside the website URL the website is secure

I have also added [Hardenize](https://www.hardenize.com/) to check on our security and this is what the badge looks like&#8230;

<a href="https://www.hardenize.com/report/jas-team.net?summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://badge.hardenize.com/v2/images/hardenize-badge-jas-team.net.png" width="70" height="110" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" /></a>

We have also done some SSL tweaks to make our site as secure as ever.

&nbsp;

### What we’re planning:

We are also planning to do proper helpful blog posts on random tech topics but this won’t take effect until next year (2018).

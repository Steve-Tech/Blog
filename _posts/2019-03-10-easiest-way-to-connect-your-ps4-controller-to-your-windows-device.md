To all my fellow PS4 users who might feel a bit left out with how Xbox controllers can connect to Windows devices but PS4 controllers cannot, this is the tutorial for you!

Using these 3 simple steps you can seamlessly connect your PS4 and get back to playing ASAP.

Required materials:

  * Dualshock 4 (PS4) controller
  * Windows Device
  * Micro USB cable _(optional)_

&nbsp;

Step 1: Get DS4Windows

Due to the differing Operating Systems (OS), you require a program called [DS4Windows](https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows) to allow for communication between the controller and your device.

You can get DS4Windows from the latest [GitHub Build](https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows)

&nbsp;

Step 2: Install the Program

Extract the ZIP file and open the file named &#8220;DS4Windows.exe&#8221;

Follow the prompts given.

For Step 1 (the step named &#8220;Install the DS4 Driver&#8221;), if your OS is Windows 7 or older, you have to install the 360 driver as well.

&nbsp;

Step 3: Connect your controller to your Windows device

Use either Bluetooth or your Micro USB cable to connect to your device.

&nbsp;

For the wired connection (micro USB connection):

All you have to do is connect to your PC or laptop. Windows should recognise it and you’re good to go!

&nbsp;

For the Bluetooth connection:

To connect the PS4 controller via Bluetooth all you have to do is press and hold the PS Button (small button on the bottom) and the Share button (together) for three seconds until the lightbar at the top of the controller begins to flash.

Then you have to open your Bluetooth settings. If you are using a Windows 10 computer, a speech bubble icon should appear on the bottom-right corner of your screen. Click on the bubble and from there click &#8220;Bluetooth&#8221; and then select the option named &#8220;Wireless Controller.&#8221; On other OS versions, just follow the prompts that lead you here. They should be pretty similar.

Sometimes you are asked to enter a pair code. If you are, just type in 0000.

&nbsp;

There you have it. Your Dualshock 4 controller is now connected to your Windows Device!

I hope you found this helpful!

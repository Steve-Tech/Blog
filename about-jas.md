#### Our Story
JAS Tech was formed in 2014 by a group of kids willing to take part in programming and software design. Our website was originally a place to download our apps and programs but it has since been turned into a tech blog.

#### The 'Team'
Stephen started off with Batch and VBS and then discovered HTML. He can also do a lot of other programming languages such as Java and Python. Jishnu started off with Visual Basic Script and in 2015 started HTML with Stephen. He was also learning C#.
